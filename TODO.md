# TODO
* Finish making B/W mode work well
* Experiment with a colour mode either modulating the colour with the phase of the carrier or simply reducing the framerate to 1fps and using the other two possible frames for colour
* Implement existing NBTV standards
* Improve the UI (more options, more overall control)
